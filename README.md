# Inspiration
## Psychiatrists and psychologists will often tell a patient to journal their thoughts and utilize that writing as one of the tools for diagnosis. We hope that DollarDiagnosis can serve as a bridge between real therapy and self-diagnosis through social media and Google!

# What it does
Securely logs a user in and provides a diagnosis for each journal they write. The hope is that people gain awareness of their mental wellness and it can also serve as a method to un-diagnose patients as they improve their tools and strategies for coping with mental health.

# How we built it
Utilized T3 stack because we need quick usage of authentication for a secure medical application.

# Challenges we ran into
The client side for NextJS refused to connect with Claud API and they had their most recent update yesterday so these interactions are still brand new! I'm hoping that I can have some work arounds soon.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we finished up our MVP and will continue to work on this product in the future!

# What we learned
We learned that you can't make client side, external API calls since they aren't as secure as keeping it on server and proxying.

# What's next for DollarDiagnosis
Prompt Engineering accurate diagnosis and testing Google's upcoming MedAI.
Take in previous context from a user and have a continued stream of improvement.
Communication and prompt engineering between top psychologists in pursuit of understanding how to best heal the mind, best therapies, and coping strategies.
Conducting studies showing benefits of this application versus not going to therapy control group.
